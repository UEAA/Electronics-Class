##Robotics/Electronics Lesson 4  

###Overview
In this lesson we will learn the code and wiring for a traffic light. If time permits we will learn for loops.

###Plan  
1. Assistants will review concepts from the previous lesson  
2. Hand out traffic light code worksheet  
3. Students will complete the worksheet  
4. Assistants will go over worksheet with students on the board  
5. Students will wire a traffic light  
  
####Activity 1: Review lesson 3  
**XIAOLIN & JACKIE**  
**Blinking Led**    
1. **Students: Give examples in the real world that blink/flash**  
	- Car light's that's blinking when making a turn  
	- Walk light blinking  
	- Police lights blinking  
2. **Students: Why is blinking important?**  
	- It acts as communication. For example a walk light blinking is telling you to hurry up. A charger blinking is telling you it's running out of battery.  
	- Everything around you is communicating something.  
4. Draw a circuit on the board with led, wires and battery  
5. **Students: How does it work?**   
    - Show that blinking is done by turning on and off electricity. Turn off electricity by showing a open circuit. Turn on electricity by showing a closed circuit. Ask students what type of circuit it is when demonstrating.  
6. **Students: What does it being done between turning on and off**  
	- Time is passing  
7. **Students: What is the function in code to wait for time?**  
	- delay(1000);  
8. **Students: What does the delay function take?**  
	- milliseconds  
9. **Students: Test seconds/milliseconds**  
	- how many milliseconds are in .5, 1, 5 seconds?  
	- how many seconds is 2000, 5500, 200 milliseconds?

####Activity 3: Traffic Light Review  
**XIAOLIN, JACKIE, JOYCE** will review the worksheet  

***  

####Activity 4: Traffic Light Wiring  
Students will wire the traffic light base on the code from the worksheet. Assistants and instructor will go around assisting students when needed.
