##Robotics/Electronics Lesson 6  

###Overview  
In this lesson students will lean to create a controllable robotic arm while drinking bubble tea (*hopefully).  

###Plan  
1. Analog vs Digital  
2. Servo  
3. Potentiometer  
4. Robotic Arm Code  
5. Robotic Arm Design  
6. Robotic Arm Wiring  
7. Electronics led sign

####Analog vs Digital  
[Reference Link](http://www.dummies.com/programming/electronics/the-difference-between-analog-and-digital-electronics/)  
Analog is measured.  
Digital is counted.  

Example: Cake recipe requires 2 cups of flour (analog since you aren't getting exactly 2 cups) and 2 eggs (digital since it's exactly 2).

####Servo   
**HUDDLE**  
Students: Where are motors used? ie. cars, robots, planes  

Servos moves 180 degrees.

####Potentiometer  
Potentiometer is an adjustable resistor. As you turn the knob it will increase or decrease the resistance which then can be measured.

####Robotic Arm Code  
[Coding Tutorial Link](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Knob)  
A robotic arm requires the potentiometer and servo. Potentiometer will return a value that will adjust the rotation of the servo.

####Robotic Arm Design  
Students will create a mini robotic arm out of paper or cardboard and tape.  

####Robotic Arm Wiring

####Electronics led sign  
The last part of the class we will have the students and assistants create an led sign with the word electronics and light it up with the lights turned off!!!  

*Give out contact information and end the class with a speech (assistants and instructors)*
