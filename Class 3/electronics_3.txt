##Robotics/Electronics Lesson 3  

###Overview
In this lesson we will learn how to code a blinking led. Then students will create a traffic light using what we learned so far. We will also learn how to code and wire a button.  

###Plan  
1. Assistants will review concepts from the previous lesson  
2. Hand out code from previous lesson  
3. Blinking light activity  
4. Traffic light activity  
5. Button activity

####Activity 1: Review lesson 2
**JOCYE**  
**Led**  
1. Draw only the led on the board.  
![led2](led2.png)
2. In a led electron flow one way. Take out an led from the kit.  
3. To the class: *Which way does the electrons flow? From the long leg or the short leg?*  
3. **Electron flow from the long leg to the short leg.**  
  
**XIAOLIN**  
**Jumper Wire**  
1. Draw a battery on top of led.  
2. To the class: *To connect the battery to the lead what do we need?*  
3. **We need jumper wires.** Show the class a jumper wire.  
4. Connect wires from the battery to the led on the board.  

**Resistor**  
1. To the class: *If an led gets electrons too fast what will happen to it?*  
2. **It will burn out**  
3. To the class: *To reduce the speed of the electrons what do we need?*  
4. **We need a resistor to slow down the electrons.** Show the class a resistor.  
5. Draw a resistor on the board  

**JACKIE**  
   
**Breadboard**  
1. Draw the breadboard on the board  
2. Show the breadboard to the class  
2. To the class: *Why do we need a breadboard?*   
3. **To create circuits and makes it easier so we don't need to tie wires together**   
4. To the class: *What happens if I put a wire on **row 1 column 1**? What holes get electricity?*  
5. **The entire first row**
![breadboard](breadboard.png)
6. To the class: *What happens if I put a wire on **row 3 column 1**? What holes get electricity?*  
7. **Column 1 and Rows 3-7**  
8. To the class: *What happens if I put a wire on **row 8 column 2**? What holes get electricity?*  
9. **Column 2 and Rows 8-12**

**Activity 2: Blinking Light**  
1. **Give examples in the real world that blink/flash**  
	- Car light's that's blinking when making a turn  
	- Walk light blinking  
	- Police lights blinking  
2. **Students: Why is blinking important?**  
	- It acts as communication. For example a walk light blinking is telling you to hurry up. A charger blinking is telling you it's running out of battery.  
	- Everything around you is communicating something.  
3. **Students: How does it work?**   
    - It turns on and off the switch in a circuit  
4. **Demonstrate by turning off and on the light in the class room**  
5. **Students: What does it being done between turning on and off**  
	- Time is passing  
6. **Teach milliseconds. 1000 milliseconds are in a 1 second**  
	- How many millis in .5, 2, 2.75 seconds?  
7. **Introduce the **delay(1000);** function**  


**Blinking Light Code**  
*Students will be required to write the code below on a piece of paper*

**Activity 3: Traffic Light**  
*Given what they have learned so far, students will be required to work together to write code to create a traffic light and then wire it on the board*  
**Easy code**  
![traffic code easy](Screen%20Shot%202017-07-05%20at%2010.46.10%20PM.png)
**Complex code with for loop**  
![traffic code hard](Screen%20Shot%202017-07-05%20at%2010.44.35%20PM.png)  
Wiring: wire three jumper wires from the pins into the three led with resistors on the board. Then connect the led to a row that it is connected to ground.

**Activity 4: Push button**  
1. DigitalRead read inputs and check for HIGH or LOW.  
2. If statements are conditions. If I give you money you give water.  
**Code for button**

**Wiring for button**
