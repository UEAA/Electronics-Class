##Electronics Lesson 5 - Doorbell

###Overview  
In this lesson we learn the programming and wiring for a button and a buzzer. Students will then create a doorbell using a button, a buzzer and a led.  

###Plan  
0. How does a button/doorbell work?  
1. Learn digitalRead  
2. Learn if statements  
3. Learn tone & noTone  
4. Doorbell Coding Activity  
5. Learn button & +5 voltage  
6. Learn buzzer  
7. Doorbell Wiring Activity  

####Concept 1: How does a button/doorbell work?  
A simple way to think of a button is that it switches between an open or close circuit. This can be done by just closing or opening a wire in the circuit. *If we want to do more complex task in CODE we have to READ the value of the button then do the action.* ie. if we press right arrow then the cursor should move right, if press the power button then my computer/tv should turn on.  

####Concept 1.1: What does a doorbell have?  
A light and a buzzer.  

####Concept 2: digitalRead  
[digitalRead Reference](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/DigitalRead)  
digitalRead is a function that reads a pin and return HIGH or LOW  

code:  
`buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin);`

**students:**  
if there is electricity at this hole in the breadboard then what should digitalRead return? If there is no electricity?  

####Concept 3: if statements  
[if statement reference](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Else)  
If statements allow you do actions base on a valid condition. ie. If I put a quarter into the vending machine then I get a cookie. If I get a 100 on an exam then I get bubble tea else do push ups.  

**who here has to do some kind of chore?**

**ask if your parents ask you clean your room you get bubble tea else you get yelled at**

code:  
`if(100 on exam) {`  
`getBubbleTea();`  
`} else {`  
`doPushUps();`  
`}`  

**students:**  
can anyone give me examples of if statements in real life? Act out an example: if lights off then close eyes else open eyes.  

####Concept 4: tone & noTone  
[tone reference](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Tone)  
In doorbell there's a buzzer. To create sound use `tone` and stop the sound use `noTone`.  

####Activity 1: Doorbell Code  
Students will work on a fill in the blank worksheet. Assistants/Instructor will help out if needed.

5 Volts
Resistor for reading low value
